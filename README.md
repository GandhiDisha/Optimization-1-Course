# Optimization-1-Course
This repository is for the Optimisation 1 course I pursued as a part of the Masters program in Business Analytics from University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business.

As a part of the course, I have completed 3 group projects and 5 Homework Assignments apart from a Midterm Exam and a Final Exam.
